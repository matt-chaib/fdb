- Make points on the graph selectable
- At the selected time point, a graph appears which is a stacked bar chart showing the breakdown of assets (savings, free cash, investments, house)
- User can add income value before or after tax/other costs (estimated based on "profile" e.g. did you study?)
- User should be able to enter mortgage, deposit, interest rate, and if overpayments are made. Chart should figure out when costs drop. 
- Should some costs be "additive/cumulative" rather than replacing others?
- Allow "timestamps" to be shown for retirement age, mortgage paid moment etc...
